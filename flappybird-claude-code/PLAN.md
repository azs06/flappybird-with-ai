# Flappy Bird Clone Development Plan

## Core Files Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure with canvas element
- `style.css` - Styling for the game interface and responsive design
- `game.js` - Main game logic and mechanics
- `assets/` - Directory for game sprites/sounds (if needed)

## Game Components to Implement

### 1. HTML Structure
- Canvas element for game rendering
- Start screen overlay
- Game over screen
- Score display
- Instructions/controls

### 2. CSS Styling
- Responsive canvas sizing
- Game UI styling (buttons, score, overlays)
- Background styling
- Mobile-friendly touch controls

### 3. JavaScript Game Logic
- **Bird mechanics**: Physics (gravity, jump velocity, collision detection)
- **Pipe system**: Random height generation, scrolling movement, collision boundaries
- **Game states**: Start screen, playing, game over, restart
- **Scoring system**: Point tracking, high score storage (localStorage)
- **Input handling**: Spacebar/click/touch controls
- **Animation loop**: 60fps game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- **Audio** (optional): Jump and score sound effects

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up basic HTML structure with canvas
2. Create CSS for responsive design and UI elements
3. Implement bird physics and movement
4. Add pipe generation and scrolling system
5. Implement collision detection
6. Add game states and UI screens
7. Implement scoring and local storage
8. Add responsive controls and polish
9. Test across different devices/browsers

## Key Features
- Smooth 60fps gameplay
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Local high score persistence
- Clean, minimal UI matching original game feel

## Technical Requirements
- Pure HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- CSS3 for responsive design
- LocalStorage for high score persistence
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animation
- Touch and keyboard input support

# Flappy Bird Clone Development Plan

## 1. Project Setup

- Create a new project folder (e.g., `flappybird-clone`).
- Inside, create the following files:
  - `index.html`
  - `style.css`
  - `game.js`
- Optionally, add a `README.md` and an `assets/` folder for images/sounds.

---

## 2. Basic HTML Structure

- Set up a simple HTML file with a `<canvas>` element for rendering the game.
- Link the CSS and JS files.

---

## 3. Styling (CSS)

- Style the canvas to be centered and give the page a simple background.
- Add styles for game over screens, score display, etc.

---

## 4. Game Logic (JavaScript)

### a. Canvas Setup
- Get the canvas context and set its width and height.

### b. Game Loop
- Implement a game loop using `requestAnimationFrame`.

### c. Bird Mechanics
- Create a bird object with properties: position, velocity, gravity.
- Implement jump/flap mechanics (on spacebar or click).

### d. Pipes
- Generate pipes at intervals.
- Move pipes to the left.
- Detect when pipes go off-screen and remove them.

### e. Collision Detection
- Check for collisions between the bird and pipes or ground/ceiling.

### f. Scoring
- Increase score when the bird passes through pipes.

### g. Game Over & Restart
- Show a game over screen and allow the player to restart.

---

## 5. Enhancements (Optional)

- Add sound effects for flapping, scoring, and collisions.
- Add animations or sprite images for the bird and background.
- Make the game responsive for different screen sizes.

---

## 6. Testing

- Playtest the game to ensure mechanics feel right.
- Fix bugs and polish the experience.

# Flappy Bird Clone Development Plan

This document outlines the plan for developing a Flappy Bird clone using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the game structure.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game.
*   `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## 1. HTML Structure (`index.html`)

*   Create a `<canvas>` element to serve as the game's screen.
*   Link to the `style.css` file for styling.
*   Link to the `script.js` file for game functionality.

## 2. Styling (`style.css`)

*   Apply basic styles to center the game on the page.
*   Style the `<canvas>` element with a border and a background color to create the game's visual theme.

## 3. Game Logic (`script.js`)

*   **Game Variables**: Initialize variables to manage the game's state, including:
    *   Bird's position and velocity.
    *   Gravity's force.
    *   Pipe properties (width, gap, speed).
    *   Score and game-over status.
*   **Game Loop**: Create a central game loop to:
    *   Continuously update the game's state.
    *   Redraw the canvas in each frame.
*   **Bird Mechanics**:
    *   Control the bird's movement by applying gravity in each frame.
    *   Implement a jump function to allow the bird to move upward when the player interacts (e.g., presses the spacebar).
*   **Pipe Generation**:
    *   Generate pipes at regular intervals.
    *   Move the pipes from right to left across the screen.
*   **Collision Detection**:
    *   Implement logic to detect when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
    *   Trigger a "game over" state upon collision.
*   **Scoring**:
    *   Increment the player's score each time the bird successfully passes through a pair of pipes.
*   **Game Over**:
    *   When the game ends, display a "Game Over" message and the final score.

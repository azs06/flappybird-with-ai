# Flappy Bird with AI

Flappy is a viral game from 2013. The game is very simple, but it is very addictive. The game is about a bird that has to fly through pipes without hitting them.

I have tested several AI tools to generate the code for this game. This is the prompt I used:

```
Create a plan for developing a Flappy Bird clone using hmtl, css and javascript.
```

Once the plan is generated, I asked the AI to generate the code for each step of the plan.

Not all AI created a plan, some went directly into generating the code, specilized AI tools like loveable and bolt.new, straight up ignored the instruction and generated flappy bird using react. I used the following AI tools:

* Augment: with the Auto mode(trial version)
  * <https://www.augmentcode.com/>
* Bolt.new:
  * <https://bolt.new/>
* ChatGPT: Model GTP-03-high
  * <https://chatgpt.com>
* ChatGPT: Model GTP-4o With Copilot
  * <https://github.com/features/copilot>
* Cline: With XAI(Which is free to use for now)  
  * <https://cline.bot/>
* RooCode: With DeepSeek R1 0528 from openrouter
  * <https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/>
* Cursor: With the Auto mode
  * <https://www.cursor.com/>
* Windsurf: With SE-1 Model
  * <https://windsurf.com/>
* Claude Web: With Claude 4 Opus
  * <https://claude.ai/>
* Claude Code: With Sonnet 4
  * <https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code>
* Gemini 2.5 pro web:
  * <https://gemini.google.com/app>
* VS Code Copilot: With Gemini 2.5 Pro
  * <https://github.com/features/copilot>
* Trae: With Default Sonnet 3.7:
  * <https://trae.ai/>
* V0.dev: With the Auto mode
  * <https://v0.dev/>
* Loveable: With the Auto mode
  * <https://lovable.app/>
* Bolt.new: With the Auto mode
  * <https://bolt.new/>
* VS Code with Gemini Code Assist:  
  * <https://codeassist.google/>
* DeepSeek Online:
  * <https://chat.deepseek.com/>

## Results

* Augment: Created the most polished version of the game, with a well structured plan and code. The game even had sound effects and animations. It was my first time using Augment, and I was blown away by the quality of the output.

* Bolt.new: Did not follow the instructions, generated a react version of the game, which was not what I wanted. The code was good, but it was not what I wanted.  

* Cursor: Followed the instructions and generated a plan, the game was also quite good. The game was playable and had no bugs, I used Cursor's auto mode, on trial version, considering the price I think Cursor is a great tool for developers.

* Cline with XAI: Generated a spec document and then created the code based on that spec. The game was playable, it was not as polished as augment, claude or cursor, but it was still good, and considering it's free to use, I think for free you can't beat it.


## Final Thought

While it may simple to develop a flappy bird clone, it is still has few complexities. Not all AI perfomed the same, when it comes to following the instructions and creating a output that works really well, claude opus 4, Augment, and cursor were the best. Augment is on a league of it's own to be fair, the way it generated plan and created a a polished version of the game really surprised me.

Cursor was also very good, It followed instructions and generated a plan, and the game developed formt he plan was quite good.

Cline with xAi really surprised me, people don't talk about it much whencomes to progrramming, but it's output was really good, it generated a spec document and then created the code based on that spec. And the game was playable, it was not as polished as augment or claude, but it was still good, and considering it's free to use, I think it is a great tool for developers.

RooCode With DeepSeek R1 0528 was a mixed result, it generated a plan and developed the game, but the assets were missing, and the game was not playable, once I added the assets it only worked then, the code was good, but it was unplayable without the assets. I added assets from the internet and it looks like abomination, but it works!

Most disappointing was Gemini 2.5 pro with copilot, it did not generated a plan, went straight into the code, and the game was running, but it had a lot of bugs, like you would get pipes without no gaps, and speed is too fast, things like that, I was expecting better from it. On the other hand Both gemini 2.5 pro web and gemini code assist generated playable game without any major issues, so I guess it might be an issue with the copilot version. With copilot the 4o version was also not as good as the others, I had high hope for copilot but it was not as polished as I expected.

Another one that was disappointng was Windsurf, it generated a plan, and developed the game, but it was not working, the game was broken, it had console errors, after some debugging I was able to fix it, but it was not a good experience compared to others. I was expecting better from it, as it's currenltly owned by OpenAI, but it seems like it is not as polished as other tools.

Another tools that surprised me was Trae, it is developed by ByteDance, and it is so cheap compared to other tools, so I had my doubts about it, by default it uses Claude 3.7, you can swith to sonnet 4 and many other models. It was successful in generating a plan and developing the game, and final result was quite good.

Amongst the web based tools like v0.dev, bolt.new and loveable, only v0.dev followed the instructions to develop the game in html, css and javascript, other straight up ignored the instructions and generated the game using react, which was not what I wanted. I also tried to give firebase studio a try, it also ignored the instructions and developed the game using react, and the game was not even playable, that's why I did not include it with the list. At present I can only use v0.dev relaiably, if you are not developing a react app I would avoid loveable and bolt.new.

Now comes my favorite one, which is at present claude code. It is a cli based tool, with pro plan you only get sonnet 4, but it is stil very good, and if you need to research you can use the web or desktop app where you can use the opus 4 model. I wish codex cli was part of plus plan from OpenAI.

## Conclusion

For most people I would recommend cursor for software development, because of it's pricing. If want the best I would suggest to go with Augment, as it will give you claude max at chepaer price. Even though it's a vscode fork, I like Cursor's UX very much, and I use it even if I am not using their subscription.

If you want a general tool and some code assistance, I would recommend using gemini pro plan, as it comes with a lot of features and the gemini code assist is very good.

If you are looking for free tools, you could give cline with xAI a try, it's really good.

Also, you might wanna try trae, it is very cheap and even the free version is very good, sonnet 4 on the free version is very good deal, though there are limitations on many messages you can send per day.

# Flappy Bird Clone - Development Plan

## Project Overview
Create a browser-based Flappy Bird clone using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will feature similar mechanics to the original Flappy Bird, where the player controls a bird that must navigate through gaps between pipes.

## File Structure

    └── sounds/        # Sound effects
```

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Basic Structure (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Set up project structure
- [ ] Create basic HTML layout
- [ ] Add canvas element for game rendering
- [ ] Set up CSS for responsive design
- [ ] Initialize JavaScript files

### Phase 2: Core Game Mechanics (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Implement Bird class with physics (gravity, jump)
- [ ] Create Pipe class for obstacles
- [ ] Implement collision detection
- [ ] Add scoring system
- [ ] Create game loop

### Phase 3: Game Features (3-4 hours)
- [ ] Add background and sprites
- [ ] Implement game states (start, playing, game over)
- [ ] Add score display
- [ ] Implement high score system (local storage)
- [ ] Add sound effects and background music

### Phase 4: Polish & Optimization (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Add animations
- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Implement responsive design for different screen sizes
- [ ] Add touch controls for mobile devices
- [ ] Add visual effects (particles, etc.)

## Technical Implementation Details

### HTML Structure
- Game container with canvas element
- UI elements (score, start screen, game over screen)
- Controls overlay

### CSS Styling
- Responsive layout
- Game theming
- Animations and transitions
- Mobile-friendly controls

### JavaScript Components
1. **Game Class**
   - Game state management
   - Main game loop
   - Score tracking
   - Collision detection

2. **Bird Class**
   - Position and velocity
   - Jump mechanics
   - Animation states

3. **Pipe Class**
   - Pipe generation
   - Movement
   - Gap positioning

4. **Utils**
   - Random number generation
   - Asset loading
   - Sound management

## Testing Plan
- Unit tests for game mechanics
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile device testing
- Performance testing
- User testing for controls and difficulty

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple bird characters
- Different pipe themes
- Power-ups
- Online leaderboard
- Day/night cycles
- Special game modes

## Timeline
- Total estimated development time: 10-15 hours
- Can be completed in 1-2 weeks with part-time work

## Resources Needed
- Sprite images (bird, pipes, background)
- Sound effects (jump, score, hit, die)
- Fonts for UI elements

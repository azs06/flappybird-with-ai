# Flappy Bird Clone - Development Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for developing a Flappy Bird clone using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game will replicate the core mechanics and visual style of the original Flappy Bird game while providing a clean, modular codebase.

## Game Description

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The player taps to make the bird flap its wings and gain height, otherwise, the bird falls due to gravity.

## Technical Stack

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling
- JavaScript (vanilla) for game logic
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering

```

## Core Features

### 1. Game Initialization

- Load assets (sprites, sounds)
- Initialize game variables
- Setup canvas
- Create event listeners for input

### 2. Game Loop

- Update game state
- Handle physics
- Check for collisions
- Render game elements
- Track score
- Handle game over state

### 3. Bird Physics

- Gravity effect (constant downward force)
- Flap mechanism (upward impulse on input)
- Rotation based on velocity (tilt up when rising, down when falling)

### 4. Pipe Generation

- Random height generation within playable bounds
- Consistent gap size between top and bottom pipes
- Constant horizontal movement
- Recycling pipes that move off-screen

### 5. Collision Detection

- Bird collision with pipes
- Bird collision with ground
- Bird collision with top of screen (optional)

### 6. Scoring

- Increment score when passing through pipes
- Display current score
- Track and display high score

### 7. Visual Effects

- Background parallax scrolling
- Bird animation (wing flapping)
- Death animation
- Score display animation

### 8. Sound Effects

- Wing flap sound
- Point scoring sound
- Hit/collision sound
- Game over sound

## Game States

1. **Title Screen**: Display game title, instructions, and start button
2. **Playing**: Main gameplay
3. **Game Over**: Display score, high score, and restart button

## User Controls

- **Desktop**: Spacebar/Mouse click to flap
- **Mobile**: Touch screen to flap

## Phases of Development

### Phase 1: Basic Setup and Bird Physics

- Create project structure
- Set up HTML5 Canvas
- Implement basic bird entity with gravity and flap mechanics
- Simple input handling

### Phase 2: Pipe Generation and Movement

- Implement pipe creation with random heights
- Add horizontal scrolling for pipes
- Implement pipe recycling

### Phase 3: Collision Detection and Scoring

- Implement collision detection between bird and pipes/ground
- Add score incrementing when passing pipes
- Display current score

### Phase 4: Game States

- Add title screen
- Implement game over state
- Add restart functionality

### Phase 5: Visual and Audio Polish

- Add sprite animations
- Implement background parallax scrolling
- Add sound effects
- Add visual effects (e.g., score animation)

### Phase 6: Final Touches

- Add high score tracking (localStorage)
- Optimize for different screen sizes
- Performance optimization
- Browser compatibility testing

## Potential Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Day/night cycle
- Different bird characters
- Difficulty levels
- Medal system based on score
- Social sharing of scores

## Testing Strategy

- Manual testing during development
- Browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing
- Performance testing

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1: 1 day
- Phase 2: 1 day
- Phase 3: 1 day
- Phase 4: 1 day
- Phase 5: 2 days
- Phase 6: 1 day

Total estimated development time: 7 days

# Flappy Bird Clone Development Plan

## 1. Setup the Project

- Create a folder structure:

  ```plaintext
  flappybird/
  ├── index.html
  ├── style.css
  ├── script.js
  └── assets/
      ├── bird.png
      ├── pipe.png
      └── background.png
  ```

- Include the necessary files:
  - `index.html` for the game structure.
  - `style.css` for styling.
  - `script.js` for game logic.
  - `assets/` for images and other resources.

## 2. Game Design

- **Game Elements**:
  - Bird: Controlled by the player.
  - Pipes: Obstacles to avoid.
  - Background: Static or scrolling.
  - Ground: Moving ground at the bottom.

- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Gravity: Bird falls automatically.
  - Jump: Bird moves upward when the player clicks or presses a key.
  - Collision Detection: Check if the bird hits pipes or the ground.
  - Score: Increment when the bird passes through pipes.

## 3. Development Steps

### HTML

- Create a canvas element for rendering the game.
- Add a container for the score display.

### CSS

- Style the canvas and score display.
- Add animations for the bird and ground.

### JavaScript

- **Game Initialization**:
  - Set up the canvas and game loop.
  - Load assets (images for bird, pipes, background, etc.).

- **Game Logic**:
  - Implement gravity and jump mechanics.
  - Generate pipes dynamically.
  - Move pipes and ground.
  - Detect collisions.

- **Score System**:
  - Update and display the score.

- **Game Over**:
  - Stop the game loop and display a restart option.

## 4. Assets

- Use simple images for the bird, pipes, background, and ground.
- Optionally, create custom assets or download free ones from online resources.

## 5. Testing

- Test the game on different browsers to ensure compatibility.
- Check for performance issues and optimize the code.

## 6. Enhancements

- Add sound effects for jumping, scoring, and collisions.
- Implement a start screen and game over screen.
- Add difficulty levels (e.g., increase pipe speed over time).
- Make the game responsive for mobile devices.

## 7. Deployment

- Host the game on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
- Share the link with others for feedback.
